# Discord Bot in TypeScript

Greetings! This is my first bot written in typescript. JavaScript is something I've worked with before, however. In order to connect to the Discord API, this project uses the library "Discord.js.".



## Bot Info:

### Commands:
- `Help` - Responds with all the bot's commands
- `Ping` - Responds with 'Pong!'
